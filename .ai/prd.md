# 1. Title: PRD for API Rest Hello World

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Status: Approved

## Intro

This document outlines the requirements for a simple REST API service. The initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will provide basic health check and "Hello World" endpoints. Future enhancements will involve adding more complex REST endpoints. This project aims to establish a foundational API service that can be expanded upon.

## Goals

- Deliver a minimal, functional REST API with `/health` and `/hw` endpoints responding within 500ms under expected load.
- Define success criteria: MVP endpoints (`/health`, `/hw`) function correctly per specification, basic logging is implemented, and unit tests achieve 85%+ coverage.
- Establish a deployment process documented and executable via a single command, ensuring easy deployment and maintainability.
- Achieve 99.9% uptime for the API service during the first month post-deployment (KPI).
- Establish a clear plan for future API expansion, documented within this PRD.

## Features and Requirements

### MVP:
- `/health`: GET endpoint that returns a 200 OK status and a simple JSON payload indicating service health (e.g., `{"status": "healthy"}`).
- `/hw`: GET endpoint that returns a 200 OK status and a JSON payload with a "Hello World" message (e.g., `{"message": "Hello World"}`).

### Non-Functional Requirements (MVP):
- API should respond within 500ms under normal load.
- Basic logging for requests and errors.

## Epic List

### Epic-1: MVP - Core API Endpoints
    - Focus: Deliver the essential `/health` and `/hw` endpoints.
### Epic-2: Future - Expanded REST Functionality
    - Focus: Add more complex endpoints based on future requirements (e.g., CRUD operations, data manipulation).
### Epic-3: Future - Observability Enhancements
    - Focus: Improve logging, add metrics, implement tracing.
### Epic-4: Future - Security Hardening
    - Focus: Implement authentication, authorization, rate limiting.
### Epic-5: Documentation & Tooling
    - Focus: Establish and maintain comprehensive project and API documentation and supporting tools.

## Epic 1: Story List (MVP)

- Story 1: Project Setup & Health Check Endpoint
  Status: ''
  Requirements:
  - Set up the basic project structure (language/framework to be determined).
  - Implement the `/health` GET endpoint.
  - Add basic request logging.
  - Write unit tests for the health check endpoint.

- Story 2: Hello World Endpoint
  Status: ''
  Requirements:
  - Implement the `/hw` GET endpoint.
  - Add unit tests for the hello world endpoint.

## Epic 5: Story List (Documentation & Tooling)

- Story 3: Initial Project Documentation (README)
  Status: ''
  Requirements:
  - Create a comprehensive `README.md` file.
  - Explain project purpose, structure, setup, and usage.
  - Include build and run instructions (Docker).

- Story 4: API Auto-Documentation Setup (OpenAPI/Swagger)
  Status: ''
  Requirements:
  - Configure FastAPI to automatically generate OpenAPI documentation (Swagger UI/ReDoc).
  - Ensure endpoints (`/health`, `/hw`) are correctly documented using Pydantic models and docstrings following best practices.

- Story 5: Postman Collection Generation
  Status: ''
  Requirements:
  - Generate a Postman collection from the OpenAPI specification.
  - Include requests for the `/health` and `/hw` endpoints.

- Story 6: Documentation Maintenance Rule Creation
  Status: ''
  Requirements:
  - Create a new Cursor rule (`.cursor/rules/py-rules/fastapi-documentation-maintenance-agent.mdc`).
  - The rule should guide the AI to update the README, OpenAPI docs, and potentially the Postman collection whenever API endpoints or project structure change.

## Technology Stack

| Technology | Description                     | Choice Rationale (Optional) |
|------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Language   | Python (FastAPI Recommended)    | Fast, modern, easy to learn |
| Framework  | FastAPI (if Python)             | High performance, async support, auto-docs |
| Deployment | Docker                          | Containerization standard   |
| Testing    | Pytest (if Python)              | Robust Python testing framework |

}
```

### `/hw` Response Schema
```json
{
  "message": "string" // e.g., "Hello World"
}
```
