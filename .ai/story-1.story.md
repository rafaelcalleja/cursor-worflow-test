# Epic-1 - Story-1
Project Setup & Health Check Endpoint

**As a** System Operator/Developer
**I want** the basic project structure set up and a working `/health` endpoint
**so that** the service's health can be monitored and development can begin on a stable foundation

## Status

Complete

## Context

This is the first story for the "API Rest Hello World" project, establishing the basic FastAPI application structure and the essential `/health` endpoint as defined in the approved PRD (`.ai/prd.md`) and architecture (`.ai/arch.md`) documents. This story corresponds to 'Story 1' under 'Epic 1: Story List (MVP)' in the PRD.

## Estimation

Story Points: 1 (Initial estimate, subject to refinement)

## Tasks

1.  - [x] Set up the basic project structure following `.ai/arch.md` (Python/FastAPI).
    1.  - [x] Create `/app` directory and subdirectories (`api/`, `tests/`).
    2.  - [x] Create initial files (`main.py`, `api/__init__.py`, `api/endpoints.py`, `tests/__init__.py`, `tests/test_endpoints.py`, `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, `README.md`).
    3.  - [x] Populate `requirements.txt` (fastapi, uvicorn, pytest).
    4.  - [x] Create basic FastAPI app instance in `main.py`.
2.  - [x] Implement the `/health` GET endpoint in `api/endpoints.py`.
    1.  - [x] Define the endpoint function.
    2.  - [x] Return 200 OK status and JSON `{"status": "healthy"}`.
    3.  - [x] Register the endpoint router in `main.py`.
3.  - [x] Add basic request logging (Details TBD - potentially using FastAPI middleware or standard logging).
4.  - [x] Write unit tests for the `/health` endpoint in `tests/test_endpoints.py`.
    1.  - [x] Set up Pytest fixture for FastAPI TestClient.
    2.  - [x] Write test case to assert 200 status code for `/health`.
    3.  - [x] Write test case to assert correct JSON response `{"status": "healthy"}`.

## Constraints

- API response for `/health` should be < 500ms under normal load (as per PRD).
- Adhere to the project structure defined in `.ai/arch.md`.
- Technology stack as defined in PRD/Arch (Python, FastAPI, Docker, Pytest).

## Data Models / Schema

`/health` Response Schema (from PRD/Arch):
```json
{
  "status": "string" // e.g., "healthy"
}
```

## Structure

Follow the project structure outlined in `.ai/arch.md`:
```
/app
├── main.py
├── api/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── endpoints.py
├── tests/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── test_endpoints.py
├── Dockerfile
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

## Diagrams

N/A for this story initially.

## Dev Notes

- Ensure basic logging configuration meets the non-functional requirement. Decide on specific logging implementation during task execution.
- Remember TDD: Write tests before or concurrently with endpoint implementation.
