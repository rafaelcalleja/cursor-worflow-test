# List Applied Rules

## Critical Rules

- At the end of each response, include a section listing the rules applied during the generation of that response.
- The section should be clearly marked, for example: "Applied Rules:"
- List each applied rule by its full path (e.g., `core-rules/rule-generating-agent.mdc`).
- If no specific rules were applied (other than global ones like this), state that explicitly or omit the section.

## Examples

<example>

  Applied Rules:
  - global-rules/emoji-communication-always.mdc
  - py-rules/python-commenting-standard-agent.mdc
</example>
